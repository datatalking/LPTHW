# LPTHW
My kata for Zed Shaw's Learn Python The Hard Way

## Causal Abstract
A theory on robust education methods to engrain deep model or mathmatical expertise.

A daily routine of practice until you can't get it wrong while maintaining a variable balance betweeen creation and discovery of your highest pritority.

This repo uses material sourced from Zed's work and I added a bit of my own utility to the code as well as some django servings.
